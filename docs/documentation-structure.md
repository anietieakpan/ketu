# License Plate Detection and Following Vehicle Analysis System

A sophisticated system for real-time license plate detection and following vehicle analysis, designed for Raspberry Pi 5 deployment. The system combines computer vision, temporal pattern analysis, and real-time processing to identify and track potential following vehicles.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure Raspberry Pi and camera (see [Raspberry Pi Setup](docs/raspberry_pi_setup.md))

3. Run the system
```bash
python -m src.cli detect --source 0
```
